    <h1>How we've chosen the <span class="jsdayes-title">JSDayES 2020</span> talks</h1>

    <p>The organization team of the JSDayEs is almost new this year.</p>
    <p>There are 6 persons in total, 4 of them are new this year, and the rest are members of past editions.</p>
    <p>5 of us are developers, with JavaScript background and several years of experience.</p>
  
    <p>We've received 105 talks, of which:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only 16% were sent by women; 67% of the talks were sent by men and the 17% didn't inform about the gender.</li>
      <li>We received a lot of topics: architecture, frameworks, testing, VanillaJS, inspirationals, machine learning, accessibility, round table, IoT, infographic, animations, CSS...</li>
      <li>34% of the speakers are known in the community and the 68% of them, are partial known or totally unknown.</li>
      <li>For the 50% of the speakers it will be their first experience as speaker in the JSDayES.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>We wanted different type of talks for the JSDayES 2020.</p>
    
    <p>We used 5 types voting criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By author: who is the person that sent the talk? Is he/she known in the community?</li>
      <li>By experience: does he/she have enough professional experience?</li>
      <li>By topic: what is the talk about?</li>
      <li>By diversity.</li>
      <li>Random: Own criteria of the member of the organization team.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In each column, we could vote 31 points at maximum, distributed in 5 talks with 3 points, 5 talks with 2 points and 6 talks with 1 point.</p>
    <p>Only the random voting criteria gave us the liberty to vote at our own. The rest of the criterias forced us to distribute the votes depending of known speakers, unknown speakers, with experience, without experience, between men and women, etc.</p>

    <p>When we finished the votation, we chosen the 4 most voted talks of each column and also those with the maximum number of totally votes following the 5 voting criterias.</p>
    <p>There were 21 talks because in case of a tie, we had to put all those with the same score.</p>
    <p>We made a filter: talks with the same speaker, same topic, etc removing the talk with the lowest number of votes.</p>
    
    <p>After all, we have 16 talks: 14 of them will be part of the schedule and 2 as a backup. Only one spealer was also speaker on the past edition. It will depend of the confirmations we receive, that we use the discarded talks.</p>
    
    <p>The result of using this voting criteria is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>50% of the talks will be by women and 50% of the talks will be by men, although there will be a round table formed by women that it will increase the women percentage.</li>
      <li>There are two talks giving by couples: one man - man and the other man - woman (UPDATE: the talk with two speakers man - woman will be finally only man because she won't be able to attend).</li>
      <li>There will be 1 talk about accessibility, 2 about testing, 2 about Progressive Web Apps, 2 inspirational talks, 2 about Web Components, 1 about APIs, 1 about FullStack, 1 about Frameworks, 1 about Tooling, 1 about Machine Learning, 1 about VanillaJS and 1 round table.</li>
      <li>8 of the speakers are very known on JavaScript community and 8 partial known or totally unkown.</li>
      <li>3 of the speakers never have been before in a conference like this, as speaker.</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <p>And from the organization we are aware of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We discarded talks about IoT, CSS related with JavaScript, animations... sorry we only have a few slots.</li>
      <li>We discarded talks sent by great developers, known and unknown.</li>
      <li>Despite having 4 men's talks for every woman's talk, it is necessary for the sector that 50% of these are women's.</li>
      <li>We can't choose all the talks.</li>
      <li>There is no a voting criteria 100% fair nor valid and liked for all the people.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>We are convinced that with the diversity of gender and topics, and the opportunity for new speakers, a good event will come out, but it will be the attendees who will judge if we made a good selection.</strong></p>
