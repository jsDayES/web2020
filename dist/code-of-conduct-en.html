		<h1>Code of conduct JSDayES 2020</h1>

        <p>JSDayES is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.</p>

        <p>We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by JSDayES or not.</p>

        <p>To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, volunteers, sponsors and providers at any JSDayES event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct</p>

        <p>Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

        <h2>Our standards</h2>

        <p>JSDayES is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.</p>

        <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Being kind to others</li>
            <li>Behaving professionally</li>
            <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
            <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
            <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
            <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Harassment of conference participants in any form</li>
            <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
            <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
            <li>Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks</li>
            <li>Insults or put downs</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Consequences of unacceptable behavior</h2>

        <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the conference without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>All JSDayES attendees are subject to the Code of Conduct. This includes our staff and volunteers, as well as attendees of the tutorials or workshops, talks sessions, receptions, sponsored talks, coffee break, lunch, any networking activity or unofficial events and our sponsors and providers, in all community venues, online and in-person.</p>

        <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the Code of Conduct. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized  clothing / uniforms / costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

        <h2>Reporting</h2>

        <p>If you believe someone has violated this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer space.</p>

        <p>You can make a report either personally or anonymously.</p>

        <h3>Anonymous Report:</h3>

        <p>You can make an anonymous report in the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/gRD6vP1Tb5qPqdI33">anonymous reporting form</a>. We cannot directly follow-up an anonymous report, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.</p>

        <h3>Personal Report:</h3>

You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.</p>
